# Generative Models

This repository contains implementations and tutorials for various generative and self-supervised learning (SSL) models. Each model is organized in its own subdirectory, and includes code, tutorials, and documentation.

## Models Included

1. **VAE (Variational Autoencoder)**  
   - A probabilistic model for unsupervised learning of latent representations.
   - [Details and Code](./VAE/README.md)

2. **SSL (Self-Supervised Learning) - SimSiam**  
   - A self-supervised learning model for learning representations without the need for negative pairs.  
   - [Details and Code](./SSL/README.md)

3. **Diffusion Models** (Coming Soon)  
   - Advanced generative models that learn to denoise data in iterative steps.  
   - Placeholder for future implementations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GenerativeModels.git
   cd GenerativeModels
